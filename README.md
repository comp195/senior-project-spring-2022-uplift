Galleries, menus and business hours will be accessible for viewing.
  
Project components:
   Entry access to our website will be the homepage that displays our banner, a short descrition about our website's purpose and two buttons on the corners. One of the buttons will allow access to the "Contact Us" page containing all of our contact information such as emails, phone numbers and a text box that will allow users to us comments/leave messages. The second button will allow access to our "About Me" page which displays information about our individual contribution to the website and our personal statements. A categories page will be incorporated into our website to allow users to select a specific category like cafes, fitness, etc. and then select a store within that category. After a specific category page is selected, a sub category page will display all the businesses that falls under the selected category. Every business wil have an individual page that will allow users to select the abailable optios offered such as gallery, menu, schedule, and an about me page.
