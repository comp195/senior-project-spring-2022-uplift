Project description:
  A website that features locally owned businesses in the Stockton, CA area. Local residents and the general public will be able to discover unknown restaurants, cafes, and fitness gyms/clubs in efforts to support small business owners. Galleries, menus and business hours will be accessible for viewing.
  
Project components:
   Entry access to our website will be the homepage that displays our banner, a short descrition about our website's purpose and two buttons on the corners. One of the buttons will allow access to the "Contact Us" page containing all of our contact information such as emails, phone numbers and a text box that will allow users to us comments/leave messages. The second button will allow access to our "About Me" page which displays information about our individual contribution to the website and our personal statements. A categories page will be incorporated into our website to allow users to select a specific category like cafes, fitness, etc. and then select a store within that category. Once they select the store then it will open another webpage which will have options for the user to choose like a gallery which is a bunch of picutres of the store, the menu of a cafe or restaurant, and about which explains the store.
  Roles we have for our team is the web designer which is Marcos, Tea is the project leader, and Symohn is the system administrator.
  
Special notes:
- Work on system administration portion; get a DNS for the website for other people to join
- Figure out how to work the category page with subcategories
- Research how to use database for userID and passwords
