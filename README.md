Project description:
  A website that features locally owned businesses in the Stockton, CA area. The website allows local residents and the general public to discover unknown restaurants, cafes, and fitness gyms/clubs in efforts to support small business owners. Galleries, menus and business hours will be accessible for viewing.
  
Project components:
  Some components that we'll have is the introduction or also known as the homepage where the user will be able to login to their account. The homepage will also have two buttons on the corners. One will be to contact us and it will contain all our contact information like email and phone number. And the other button will be a "About Me" which will open another webpage to a description of our mission for this website. Other components is the categories page which will allow the user to select a specific category like cafes, fitness, etc. and then select a store within that category. Once they select the store then it will open another webpage which will have options for the user to choose like a gallery which is a bunch of picutres of the store, the menu of a cafe or restaurant, and about which explains the store.
  Roles we have for our team is the web designer which is Marcos, Tea is the project leader, and Symohn is the system administrator.
  
Special notes:
- Work on system administration portion; get a DNS for the website for other people to join
- Figure out how to work the category page with subcategories
- Research how to use database for userID and passwords
