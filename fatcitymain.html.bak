<h2> A native of Stockton, Don developed a love for BBQ when he and his best friend Noah starting 
smoking ribs. He's very passionate about the California Style BBQ that he spent years perfecting. 
That love for cooking lead to him opening a retail store in 2010. The immersion into the world of 
BBQ then lead Don to wanting more. What was once a hobby, grew into a career and Fat City Brew & BBQ
was born. <h2>
